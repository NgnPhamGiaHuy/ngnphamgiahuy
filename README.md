## üß† My Journey

My path as a developer began with crafting beautiful interfaces in React and Next.js, carefully designing each component to enhance user experiences. What started as a passion for frontend soon evolved as I found myself asking: *"What happens behind the scenes?"* This curiosity led me to venture into backend territory, exploring Node.js, databases, and system architectures.

Today, I stand at an exciting intersection of full-stack development and artificial intelligence. I'm fascinated by how AI can transform applications from merely functional to genuinely intelligent. By integrating LLMs like ChatGPT and custom ML models into my projects, I've discovered ways to automate workflows, generate content, and solve complex problems that would be impossible with traditional programming alone.

## üöÄ What I Create

I build applications that blend modern interfaces with intelligent backends. My work focuses on:

- **Socially Conscious Applications** that connect people around meaningful causes, like my environmental collaboration platform Recial
- **AI-Enhanced Experiences** that leverage large language models to generate content and provide personalized recommendations
- **Scalable Architectures** designed to handle growing user bases and evolving requirements through microservices and thoughtful system design

## üìÇ Featured Projects

### üå≥ Recial - Social Network for Environmental Collaboration

Recial emerged from a simple question: what if social media could drive positive environmental change? I built this platform to connect environmentalists, volunteers, and conscious citizens in collaborative eco-initiatives.

The application features real-time chat capabilities powered by WebSockets, allowing immediate coordination between users. The media sharing system, built with Firebase, enables activists to share their progress through photos and live streams, creating accountability and inspiration. User authentication is handled securely through JWT and NextAuth, ensuring that sensitive environmental data remains protected.

**Tech Story:** Built with React and Redux for state management, styled with TailwindCSS for responsive design across all devices, and backed by Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for a flexible document-based data structure.

### üöÄ CVGenius - AI Resume Analyzer

I created CVGenius to solve a critical problem job seekers face: getting meaningful feedback on their resumes. This specialized application leverages AI to analyze resumes and provide precise, actionable recommendations that can increase interview callback rates within minutes of use.

The system evaluates resumes across five key dimensions: ATS compatibility, content quality, structural organization, tone and style, and skills alignment. By processing a resume and job description together, CVGenius delivers personalized insights within 30 seconds, highlighting specific improvements that can increase a resume's effectiveness by up to 40%.

**Tech Story:** Developed with React and TypeScript for a responsive frontend, styled with TailwindCSS for a clean user interface, and powered by Claude 3.7 Sonnet AI via the Puter.js platform. State management is handled by Zustand, with React Router providing seamless navigation through the analysis workflow.

## üîß How I Build

I believe technology choices should serve the project's purpose rather than dictate its limitations. My toolkit has evolved to include:

<div align="center">
<h3>Frontend Foundations</h3>

![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-3178C6?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=black)
![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=next.js&logoColor=white)
![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind_CSS-38B2AC?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)
</div>

JavaScript and TypeScript form the basis of my development, enhanced by React's component-based architecture and Next.js for performant server-side rendering. I create responsive designs with Tailwind CSS, maintaining a clean visual language throughout the application.

<div align="center">
<h3>Backend & Data</h3>

![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Node.js-339933?style=for-the-badge&logo=nodedotjs&logoColor=white)
![Express.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=white)
![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-47A248?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-336791?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![Firebase](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firebase-FFCA28?style=for-the-badge&logo=firebase&logoColor=black)
</div>

Node.js and Express.js power most of my APIs, connected to MongoDB for flexible document storage or PostgreSQL when relational data matters. Firebase accelerates development when real-time features are essential.

<div align="center">
<h3>AI Integration</h3>

![Claude](https://img.shields.io/badge/Claude_AI-5A67D8?style=for-the-badge&logo=anthropic&logoColor=white)
</div>

Working with OpenAI APIs, Claude models, and Hugging Face transformers has become a central part of my workflow, allowing me to bring intelligent features to otherwise conventional applications.

<div align="center">
<h3>Development Environment</h3>

![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/Git-F05032?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)

![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)
</div>

My projects flow through Git for version control, often deployed via Docker containers for consistency across environments, and managed with tools like WebStorm for efficient coding.

## üîÆ Vision for the Future

My development roadmap extends beyond individual projects to broader technical ambitions:

- Deeper integration of specialized AI models that can understand industry-specific contexts rather than general-purpose tools
- Exploration of hybrid cloud architectures that balance cost, performance, and reliability for growing applications
- Development of more accessible interfaces that make complex data visualization intuitive for non-technical users
- Creating educational resources that help other developers incorporate AI responsibly into their own projects

## ü§ù Let's Collaborate

I approach collaboration with enthusiasm and an open mind. Whether you're a fellow developer, designer, or domain expert, I believe the best projects emerge from diverse perspectives. If you're interested in working together:

1. Check out my repositories and suggest improvements or new features
2. Reach out if you have a project idea that aligns with my skills and interests
3. Connect if you're looking for a developer who brings both technical skills and thoughtful approach

For contributions to existing projects, simply fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes. I review PRs regularly and appreciate all forms of contribution, from code to documentation improvements.
